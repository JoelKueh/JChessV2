MinMax Search
=============

The Minmax search (https://www.chessprogramming.org/Minimax) follows this
basic principle: positions are evaluated by the opponent can do. In a two-ply
search, if player one makes a move, then the value of that move is defined
by the worst response that the opponent can make.
