I strongly recomend reading the documentation in this order.

1. Dependencies 
2. CodeStructure 
3. Algorithms

I'm going to make a folder called Evaluation, that will be the place where
we can document possible solutions to move evaluation algorithms (I'll write
something up about the Transposition Table in the next couple days).
